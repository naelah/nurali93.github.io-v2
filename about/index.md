## Development

I'm currently focusing on front-end development with a little bit of back-end side and within 5 years timeframe I planned to become a fullstack developer.

Being a fullstack developer is one of my dream. Next, to start my own company but first need to gain all sorts of experience and knowledge.

I played Dota for fun! Usually a feeder but once in a while a comeback win surely will motivate my day! Come 1v1 with me (242843976). GGWP BOIS
